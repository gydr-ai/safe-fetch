# Releasing

Releases are automatic. Nobody runs `npm publish` by hand after the first
release.

## How it works

1. Pull requests are squash-merged with a Conventional Commit title.
2. On every push to `main`, the **Release** workflow runs
   [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which opens
   or updates a pull request titled `chore(main): release x.y.z` containing
   the version bump and the generated `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
3. Merging that pull request creates the `vx.y.z` tag and GitHub release.
4. The `build` job checks out the tag, runs the full check and packs the
   tarball, with no publish permission at all.
5. The `publish` job waits for approval on the protected `npm`
   environment, then **stages** that tarball through **Trusted Publishing**
   (OIDC). It installs and runs no project code, so no dependency can reach
   the publish token. npm attaches a provenance statement linking the
   package to that exact workflow run.
6. The staged version goes live only when a maintainer approves it on npm
   with 2FA (see "Approving a release").

Before 1.0.0, a breaking change bumps the minor version and a feature bumps
the patch version (`bump-minor-pre-major`, `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major`).

## One-time setup

npm only lets you trust a workflow for a package that already exists, and a
package only exists once a version is published. So the name is reserved
once with an inert placeholder, and every real version, the first included,
is staged by CI with provenance and approved by a maintainer. No npm token
is created at any point.

1. **Reserve the name** (from a clean checkout of `main`, logged in to npm
   with 2FA):

   ```bash
   node scripts/publish-placeholder.mjs
   ```

   This publishes `0.0.0-placeholder` (a README and a `package.json`, no
   code) under the `placeholder` dist-tag. It refuses to run if the package
   already exists.

2. **Trusted publisher**: on npmjs.com open the package → Settings →
   Trusted publishing → GitHub Actions, and enter:
   - Organization or user: `gydr-ai`
   - Repository: `safe-fetch`
   - Workflow filename: `release.yml`
   - Environment name: `npm`
   - Allowed actions: leave **both unticked**. The publisher may then only
     _stage_ a version (`npm stage publish`); nothing goes live until a
     maintainer approves it with 2FA.
3. **Lock it down**: Settings → Publishing access → _Require two-factor
   authentication and disallow tokens_.
4. **First real release**: follow "Approving a release" below, then deprecate
   the placeholder:

   ```bash
   npm deprecate @gydr-ai/safe-fetch@0.0.0-placeholder "Placeholder with no code; use @gydr-ai/safe-fetch@latest"
   ```

5. **GitHub environment**: Settings → Environments → `npm` → add yourself
   (or the maintainers team) as a required reviewer. The setup script
   already limits deployments to `main`.
6. **Optional GitHub App** so CI also runs on the release pull request:
   create an org-owned GitHub App with _Contents_ and _Pull requests_
   read/write, install it on this repository, then set the repository
   variable `RELEASE_APP_ID` and secret `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. Without
   it, the release pull request is opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which GitHub
   does not let trigger other workflows.

## Approving a release

Every release needs two approvals, so a compromised GitHub account or
workflow alone can never put a version on npm:

1. **GitHub**: approve the `npm` environment deployment when the Release
   workflow asks. CI then _stages_ the version with provenance.
2. **npm**: approve the staged version with your 2FA (npm 11.15.0 or later):

   ```bash
   npm stage list @gydr-ai/safe-fetch
   npm stage view <stage-id>
   npm stage approve <stage-id>
   ```

   Check that `npm stage view` shows the version, the provenance link to the
   `release.yml` run, and the expected file list before approving. Reject a
   stage you did not expect with `npm stage reject <stage-id>`.

## If publishing fails

The tag and the GitHub release exist as soon as the release pull request
merges, so a failed publish job does not need a new version. Fix the cause
on `main` first, then stage the same tag again: **Actions → Release → Run
workflow**, branch `main`, tag `vX.Y.Z`. The run rebuilds that tagged commit,
checks that its `package.json` version matches the tag, and asks for the
same two approvals. Check with `npm view @gydr-ai/safe-fetch versions` that the version is
not already on npm before you start.

## Verifying a release

```bash
npm view @gydr-ai/safe-fetch --json | jq '.dist.attestations'
npm audit signatures
```
